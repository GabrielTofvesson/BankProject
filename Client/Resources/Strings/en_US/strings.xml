	<Entry name="WS_describe1">ConsoleForms is a graphical interface API heavily inspired
by the graphics of Windows 1.0, and the functionality
of the Android UI experience.</Entry>
	<Entry name="WS_describe2">As ConsoleForms is entirely based on the console, it relies
completely on keyboard-based events.
For example, press the [LEFT] and [RIGHT] arrow keys to select the
options listed below.</Entry>
	<Entry name="WS_describe3">ConsoleForms also supports input fields like the one below.
To enter information into an input field, simply type.
To switch which input field you are writing in, use
the [UP] and [DOWN] arrow keys to navigate in the
corresponding direction. To navigate within a field,
use the [LEFT] and/or [RIGHT] arrow keys.
Note: to quickly navigate to the inut field below the
currently selected one, use [TAB]. To submit the input,
press [ENTER].</Entry>
	<Entry name="WS_describe4">Excellent! Now, some input fields require a certain
input format, for example: integer, decimal, e.t.c.
This means that if you enter characters that don't
conform to the set format, the characters will be
discarded.</Entry>
